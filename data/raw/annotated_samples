The directory `/SES-DocGuard/SES-DocGuard/data/raw/annotated_samples` is intended to store annotated sample data. Since this is a directory, it does not contain any files. Therefore, the contents of this directory are intentionally left blank. 

You can create this directory in your project structure, and it will be ready to store any annotated sample files you may generate or use in the future.
