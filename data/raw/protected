The directory `/SES-DocGuard/SES-DocGuard/data/raw/protected` is intended for storing proprietary data. Since this is a directory, it does not contain any specific files or code. Therefore, the contents of this directory will be intentionally left blank. 

You can create the directory structure as follows:

- SES-DocGuard
  - data
    - raw
      - protected (this folder is intentionally left blank)

Make sure to create the directory in your project structure to store any proprietary data securely.
