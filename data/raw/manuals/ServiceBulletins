The directory `/SES-DocGuard/SES-DocGuard/data/raw/manuals/ServiceBulletins` is intended to store raw Service Bulletins. Since this is a directory, it does not contain any files. Therefore, the contents of this directory will be intentionally left blank. 

You can create this directory in your project structure, and it will be ready to store the relevant PDF files for processing.
