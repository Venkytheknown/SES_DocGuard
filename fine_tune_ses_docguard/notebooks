The `/SES-DocGuard/SES-DocGuard/fine_tune_ses_docguard/notebooks` directory is intended for Jupyter notebooks related to the fine-tuning process of the SES-DocGuard model. Since you requested the contents for this directory, I will create a placeholder file that can be used for future notebook development.

Here are the contents for the `notebooks` directory:

# /SES-DocGuard/SES-DocGuard/fine_tune_ses_docguard/notebooks

# This file is intentionally left blank.
